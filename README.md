# About Afsana
I am a recent graduate of Computer Science. I graduated with a Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington. Before coming to the States, I worked as the Senior Manager of ConnectJapan in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I also graduated with a Master of Science in Software Engineering from Institute of Information Technology, University of Dhaka, under the supervision of Md. Rayhanur Rahman. At IIT, I worked on bug pattern detection. My current research is focused on System infrastructure for big data, in particular, data management systems, file and storage systems, and I/O performance in high-performance computing.

# Research Interest:

My research interests are file and storage systems including systems performance optimization for big data and storage systems, systems infrastructure for big data, and high performance computing.
